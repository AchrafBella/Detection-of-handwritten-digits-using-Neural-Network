Detection of handwritten digits using neural network
==========================

Ã‰cole Centrale de Lyon - S8 UE ECL A-11 Algorithmes collaboratifs 2019-2020

During the elective: Collaborative Algorithms and Applications we had the opportunity to dig deep in neural networks by dismantle each part of the neural network from forward propagation to the backpropagation using gradient descent also to experiment some new comcepts like activation functions, Dropout, learning rate and weight initialization.

Datasets:
---------------
During this project we had 2 different dataset the famous one is mnist and the second one let's call it miniMnist which is not far from mnist but instead of coding pixels into 64*64 array we code it into an list of 50 pixels.

Models:
---------------
In this project i built 3 neural networks architectures the first one with one hidden layer, the second one with two hidden layers and the last one with three hidden layers.
we use gradient descent for the backpropagation.

To test:
---------------
- To test with mnist dataset go to Demo_mnist_data.py
- To test with Mini mnist dataset go to Demo_prof_data.py
